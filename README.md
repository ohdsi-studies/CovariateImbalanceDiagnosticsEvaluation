The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of Austinâ€™s absolute standardized mean difference statistic to identify problematic confounding in causal effects estimated in applied analyses of various sample sizes which use propensity score matching to adjust for a highly-dimensional set of covariates. We plan to conduct this evaluation within two applied, previously-investigated, clinical settings: 1) ACE inhibitors vs. thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics, and 2) ACE inhibitors vs. beta-blockers.3 Based on our prior understanding of these comparisons, we a priori expect the comparison against thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics to produce estimates with relatively little confounding and we expect the comparison against beta-blockers to produce estimates will more confounding. To evaluate the ability to accurately identify problematic confounding, we plan to identify analyses that passed the diagnostic being assessed (e.g. all covariates produced absolute mean standardized differences <= 0.10) and summarize the expected bias by means of the negative control distribution.

This work is being completed in collaboration with Azza Shoaibi, Josh Ide, Martijn Schuemie, and the OHDSI PLE/PLP workgroup.
